            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website. Here's a little about who I am.</p>
            <p>I am one of six children, the second oldest, and I grew up in Cape Town's Cape Flats. Like many who find themselves in this environment, life was far from easy. Raised by a single mom who often had no idea where our next meal would come from, I quickly learned the value of resilience and resourcefulness. Looking back, I realize that these challenges have given me a unique advantage. The fact that I came from nothing makes me appreciate everything I have today and every opportunity I’m given.</p>

            <p>In 2014, my life changed forever when I was blessed with my daughter. This moment shook me into a different gear, making me realize that I needed to find stability and become a role model for her, even before I knew her gender. This realization led me to Capitec Bank, where I felt a strong connection and saw myself as a professional. I worked hard to sell myself to the staff, eventually getting the chance to speak with the branch and regional managers. Despite my lack of professional polish at the time, they saw something in me and gave me the opportunity to compete for a spot at the company.</p>

            <p>After two months of tests and interviews, I was welcomed into the Capitec family, starting my role just one month before my daughter was born. Since then, I’ve worked my way up from a consultant to a senior branch manager. Beyond the financial security, my partner (Me Amore), and the ability to provide for my family, the greatest gift Capitec has given me is the chance to grow, to push my limits, and to bring others along on that journey. This is the culture we are creating—a place where hard work and ambition are rewarded, and where we lift each other up.</p>

            <p>As you explore the rest of this site, you’ll discover my hobbies and interests, from my love of anime to my passion for MMA and learning new things. These are not just pastimes; they are reflections of my journey, my values, and the way I approach life.</p>
